## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've learned how to use CSS Grid as well as somewhat of Flexbox while coding this project.

### Continued development

CSS in general is something I'm very new to, so I will be mostly focusing more on the CSS side of things while trying to perfect the HTML language.
